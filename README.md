# Algorithms Project

## Overview

This repository is a collection of various algorithms implemented in both JavaScript and Java for educational purposes and practice. 
Each algorithm is contained within its own file for easy reference.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- npm
- Java Development Kit (JDK)

### Usage

After successfully cloning the repository, move to the folder that houses the algorithms. 
From there, you can execute individual algorithm files by running the appropriate command.

#### For Java Algorithms

Compile the Java file:

- `javac <filename.java>`

Run the compiled program:

-    `java <filename>`


#### For JavaScript Algorithms

- `node <filename.js>`

Note: Replace `<filename>` with the actual filename you want to run.
